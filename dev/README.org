* Idea

The idea of this project is to replicate the "good" parts of biology. In
general, biology managed to create a code that is general, that can be
mutated and combined and that from a relatively 'small' number of building
blocks can create large and complex systems. 

Although we can not create our networks from building blocks like proteins,
we can give our networks properties that are 

there is a really strong winner takes all dynamics in biology, and a low
probability of mutation.


* Geometry
Could you use geometrical properties to create connectivity??? Will do for
nice visualization.
