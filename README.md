# The project
This is a supposedly fun after work project, where we use neuro evolution to
create a brain for an agent solving complex problems in a maze.  

## Installation

Create a Python 3 virtual environment and install the requirements. Depending
on your OS you need to install additional packages.

```
    python3 -m venv .pyenv
    source .pyenv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Activate your environment and run an experiment, for example the random agent:
```
    source .pyenv/bin/activate
    cd src
    ./run_experiment random
```
